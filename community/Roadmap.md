## S2C2F Roadmap

### Strategic Goals of S2C2F

The S2C2F has a number of goals that we wish to accomplish together as a community:
* **Awareness** of how to address the supply chain threats specific to open source, and understanding that the S2C2F is here to directly mitigate those issues
  * This is accomplished through collaboration with other areas of the OpenSSF, continued referencing of the S2C2F in publications
* **Community Engagement** to keep the S2C2F relevant and up-to-date on the latest threats
* **Adoption** by the industry to reduce open source supply chain risk
  * This is accomplished through industry recognition as a best practice. Adoption of the S2C2F into the OpenSSF was the first step on that journey. Pursuing international standardization is another 
  * Develop attestations of conformance to S2C2F policies 
* **Drive Tooling Innovation** across the industry to help others implement the S2C2F requirements, as well as driving innovations related to generation of claims/attestations of compliance with the S2C2F maturity levels
  * The S2C2F SIG shouldn’t be working in a silo. There needs to be conscious efforts to leverage other initiatives across the OpenSSF where it makes sense for S2C2F to be involved.
  * Tooling to generate attestations of policy conformance

### S2C2F Initiatives Seeking Community Support

These initiatives align with the strategic goals of S2C2F
* Creating reference implementation guidance for different DevOps platforms [https://github.com/ossf/s2c2f/tree/main/Reference_implementation](https://github.com/ossf/s2c2f/tree/main/Reference_implementation)
* Create Supplemental Material for deeper dives and clarification [https://github.com/ossf/s2c2f/issues/24](https://github.com/ossf/s2c2f/issues/24)
* Translations of the framework to other languages
* Pursue international standardization
* Continuous improvement leveraging feedback from those that have implemented/implementing S2C2F
* Contributing to the S2C2F attestation GitHub Action tool. Areas where we are open for contribution are listed in our tool’s Roadmap [https://github.com/ossf/S2C2F-attestation-schema-and-tool/blob/main/ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/ossf/S2C2F-attestation-schema-and-tool/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)
