# Reference Implementations

This section of the repo captures suggested ways to implement the Secure Supply Chain Consumption Framework (S2C2F) based on which CI/CD platform you are using. The suggested capabilities try leverage as much native features to the specific CI/CD environment as possible. 

We are looking for help to create pages to suggest reference implementations for the following platforms:

1. [GitHub](https://github.com/ossf/s2c2f/blob/main/Reference_implementation/GitHub.md)
2. [GitLab](https://github.com/ossf/s2c2f/blob/main/Reference_implementation/GitLab.md)
3. Jenkins
4. Circle CI
5. TeamCity
6. Travis CI
7. And more...
